# Philosophers ðŸ§  ðŸ¤”

Philosophers project to understand threads and concurrent programming

The goal of the project is to build a simulation where a number of philosophers are seated in a round table in order to eat some pasta. The number of forks should be equal to the number of philosophers.  philosopher can eat only when it have 2 forks. 

To create philosophers weâ€™re gonna use threads in C, one thread x philo

Itâ€™s important to know that threads share variables sometimes since theyâ€™re in the same memory location. So itâ€™s necessary to include mutex in order to protect the variables (to read and write).

## Important concepts

In C, pthreads (POSIX threads) and mutexes are tools used for concurrent programming, but they serve different purposes:

1. **Pthreads (POSIX Threads)**:
    - Pthreads are a standard for creating and managing threads in a Unix-like operating system.
    - A thread is a single sequence stream within a process. Multiple threads can exist within one process, sharing resources such as memory, while executing independently.
    - The **`pthread`** library provides functions to create, manage, and synchronize threads.
2. **Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion)**:
    - Mutexes are synchronization primitives used to prevent multiple threads from accessing a shared resource simultaneously, which can lead to data races.
    - A mutex can be locked by one thread and must be unlocked by the same thread, ensuring exclusive access to the shared resource during the critical section.

### Rule for assigning forks and avoiding deadlock situation

To assign the forks to the philosophers, we should have a rule to assign forks depending on the numbers of philos for the simulation
if we have odd or even will define the assignment rule

## The Workflow!

The workflow of the project will look something like this:
